This project should be completed and its capabilities tested by October 1st. If we are running late in development we will need to reduce the options in the finished product. Production will follow the software development lifecycle and consist of 5 Phases. Three of the middle phases will include 2 different development goals, A and B, which will be worked on concurrently. A and B goals will deal with non-dependant parts of the project, and the results will be integrated together (if possible) before starting the next phase.  

Current schedule markers are tentative. An online Gantt chart of this project plan can be found at  https://www.tomsplanner.com/public/ba1. Please refer to it for the latest updates to scheduling and task assignments. Password is “krowdbyz” (lowercase)
